# Palustrine

This folder contains tables associated with our analyses of palustrine wetland area.  

The [coastalLands](https://github.com/Smithsonian/Coastal-Wetland-NGGI-Sensitivity-Analysis/tree/master/data/WetlandArea/Palustrine/coastalLands) subfolder contains working files associated with our analysis of the coastal lands definition of coastal wetlands, in which area is determined by the extent of the highest monthly tidal elevations (mean higher high water spring).  

The [nwi](https://github.com/Smithsonian/Coastal-Wetland-NGGI-Sensitivity-Analysis/tree/master/data/WetlandArea/Palustrine/nwi) subfolder contains working files associated with our analysis of the intersection between wetlands mapped by the Coastal Change Analysis Program, and tidal area as mapped by the National Wetlands Inventory.
