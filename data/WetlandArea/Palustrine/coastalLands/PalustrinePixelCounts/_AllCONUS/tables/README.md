# PalustrinePixelCounts/_AllCONUS/tables

This folder contains files tracking the breakdown of probabilities of pixel elevations being lower than Mean Higher High Spring (MHHWS) tidal elevation for each coastal change analysis program 2006 to 2010/2011 class.  

Each .dbf file is representative of a 2006 to 2011 category named using the following abbreviations separated by “_”. For example a change category of Estuarine Emergent Wetland to Estuarine Scrub/Shrub is represented by EEM_ESS.  

Abbreviations follow:  
HID – High intensity developed  
MID – Medium intensity developed  
LID – Low intensity developed  
OSD – developed open space  
CULT - Cultivated  
PAST – Pasture/Hay  
GRS - Grassland  
DEC – Deciduous forest  
EVR – Evergreen forest  
MIX – Mixed forest  
SS – Scrub/Shrub  
PFW – Palustrine forested wetland  
PSS – Palustrine scrub/shrub wetland  
PEM – Palustrine emergent marsh  
EFW – Estuarine forested wetland  
ESS – Estuarine scrub/shrub  
EEM – Estuarine emergent wetland  
UCS – Unconsolidated shore  
BAR – Bare land  
OW – Open water  
PAB – Palustrine aquatic bed  
EAB – Estuarine aquatic bed  
SNOW - Snow  

Each file has two attributes:  
Value – Value represents probability of a pixel falling below MHHWS (0 to 1) multiplied by 10,000 and rounded.  
Count – 30 x 30 meter pixel count per value
