# CoastalLands

This folder contains working files associated with our analysis of the coastal lands definition of coastal wetlands, in which area is determined by the extent of the highest monthly tidal elevations (mean higher high water spring [MHHWS]).  

The [PalustrinePixelCounts](https://github.com/Smithsonian/Coastal-Wetland-NGGI-Sensitivity-Analysis/tree/master/data/WetlandArea/Palustrine/coastalLands/PalustrinePixelCounts/_AllCONUS/tables) subfolder contains files for the breakdown of probability of pixel elevations being lower than MHHWS each coastal change analysis program 2006 to 2010/2011.  

[pMHHWSforCCAPpal.dbf](https://github.com/Smithsonian/Coastal-Wetland-NGGI-Sensitivity-Analysis/blob/master/data/WetlandArea/Palustrine/coastalLands/pMHHWSforCCAPpal.dbf) – For all palustrine wetlands analysed in C-CAP, this file records the breakdown of probability below MHHWS classes. This file was used to create Supplemental Fig. 1D.  
Value – Value represents probability of a pixel falling below MHHWS (0 to 1) multiplied by 10,000 and rounded.  
Count – 30 x 30 meter pixel count per value.
