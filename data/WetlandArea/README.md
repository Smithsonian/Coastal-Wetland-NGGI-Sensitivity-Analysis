# WetlandArea

This folder contains three subfolders containing information derived from another workflow, containing tables summarizing mapped wetland areas according to different methods.  

The [CCAP](https://github.com/Smithsonian/Coastal-Wetland-NGGI-Sensitivity-Analysis/tree/master/data/WetlandArea/CCAP) subfolder contains tables associated with the Coastal Change Analysis Program.  

The [Palustrine](https://github.com/Smithsonian/Coastal-Wetland-NGGI-Sensitivity-Analysis/tree/master/data/WetlandArea/Palustrine) subfolder contains tables associated with our analyses of palustrine wetland area.  

The [test_data](https://github.com/Smithsonian/Coastal-Wetland-NGGI-Sensitivity-Analysis/tree/master/data/WetlandArea/test_data) subfolder contains miscellaneous documents used in project development, not final analyses, and therefore contain no extra documentation.
