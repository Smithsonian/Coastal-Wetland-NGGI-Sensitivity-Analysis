# Data

This folder contains tabular datasets used in the paper.

The [Biomass](https://github.com/Smithsonian/Coastal-Wetland-NGGI-Sensitivity-Analysis/tree/master/data/Biomass) subfolder contains files used in our synthesis of above ground biomass. 

The [MengReview](https://github.com/Smithsonian/Coastal-Wetland-NGGI-Sensitivity-Analysis/tree/master/data/MengReview) subfolder contains files from Meng Luâ€™s literature review supporting the U.S. Greenhouse Gas Inventory. We used these files to model carbon burial rates. 

The [Methane](https://github.com/Smithsonian/Coastal-Wetland-NGGI-Sensitivity-Analysis/tree/master/data/Methane) subfolder contains a dataset of methane emissions and removals compiled by Sara Knox for the State of the Carbon Cycle Report. 

The [outputTables](https://github.com/Smithsonian/Coastal-Wetland-NGGI-Sensitivity-Analysis/tree/master/data/outputTables) subfolders contains summary statistics and working files resulting from our Monte Carlo Uncertainty Analyses and Sensitivity Analyses. 

The [WetlandArea](https://github.com/Smithsonian/Coastal-Wetland-NGGI-Sensitivity-Analysis/tree/master/data/WetlandArea) subfolder contains tables associated with raster files from a different workflow in which coastal wetland area, change, and salinity and vegetation subclasses was mapped using the Coastal Change Analysis Program, and constrained using either the National Wetlands Inventory or a probabilistic tidal elevation map.
