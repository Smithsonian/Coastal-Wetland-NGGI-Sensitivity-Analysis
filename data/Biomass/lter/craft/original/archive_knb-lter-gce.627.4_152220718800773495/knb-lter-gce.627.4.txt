Dataset Abstract

	We established two 0.1-ha plots in the Site 11 tidal forest in December 2013 to monitor forest composition. In each plot, we identified the species and measured DBH (diameter at breast height) of every tree using standard diameter tapes. We also used the DBH measurements to calculate the basal area of each tree.
