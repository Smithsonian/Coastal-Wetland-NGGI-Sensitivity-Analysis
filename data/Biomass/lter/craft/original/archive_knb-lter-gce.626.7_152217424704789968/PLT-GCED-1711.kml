A SeaBird SBE-37M MicroCAT sonde is deployed in Lewis Creek for long-term salinity, pressure and temperature monitoring. A Rod Sedimentation-Erosion Table (RSET) is also installed to monitor changes in elevation and dendrometer bands are installed on various trees to monitor tree growth at the site.&lt;/p&gt;
