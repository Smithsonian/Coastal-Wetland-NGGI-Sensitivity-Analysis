Dataset Abstract

	We established two 0.1-ha plots in December 2013. In each plot, we identified and measured DBH (diameter at breast height) of every tree using standard diameter tapes. We also placed dendrometric bands on 40 trees (20 per plot) in December 2013. Bands were measured in December 2014 as baseline measurements and in December every year thereafter (2015, 2016).
