Dataset Abstract

	Monthly litterfall data is being collected in two mangrove-dominated regions (Shark River and Taylor Slough) in South Florida. Three sites (SRS4, SRS5, SRS6) in the Shark River region and one site (TS/Ph8) in the Taylor Slough region were used to characterize patterns of litterfall production. At each mangrove site 10 litter baskets (0.5 x 0.5 m) were placed in two 20 x 20 m plots (five baskets per plot). Data has been collected since January 2001. Statistical analysis is being performed.

Maintenance

	This is a long-term primary production dataset and subsequent data wil be appended. LT_PP_Rivera_001 will be taken offline because it was resubmitted under LT_PP_Castaneda_001 (v1-v3).  The new PASTA file is LT_PP_Castaneda_001. The FCE program is discontinuing its practice of versioning data as of March 2013.

Methods

	Sampling Description 

		Monthly litterfall data is being collected in two mangrove dominated regions (Shark River and Taylor Slough) in South Florida. Ten litter baskets ( 0.5 x 0.5 m) were placed in two 20 x 20 m plot (five baskets per plot) in each mangrove site. Experimental  design is a split-plot repeated measures ANOVA.


	Method Step 

		Description 

			Litter is collected, dried at 60 degrees celcius, and separated in different categories (e.g., leaves, propagules, wood) per species and weighted. Total carbon, nitrogen, and phosphorus is determined for each category.


		Instrumentation

			Standard laboratory drying ovens
			 furnaces
			 balances. 


		Quality Control 

			Dataset is inspected by PI for QA/QC; descriptive statistics, normal distribution plots, standard validation checks for negative numbers, graphs to detect potential outliers

Dataset Submission Date 

	2016-11-11


Data Submission Notes

	Sampling on site TS/Ph8 has been cancelled since January 2007. During 2008 and 2009, the miscellaneous component is a composite of all other components, except leaves. Beginning on January 2010 all litterfall components are registered.


Information Management Notes

	Data from 2016 onward are currently not available due to Type II Data Restrictions (Dissertation Data). This is a long-term primary production dataset and subsequent data wil be appended.
