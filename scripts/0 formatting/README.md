This folder contains scripts for some of the heavier lifts in terms of data formatting.

The [biomass](https://github.com/Smithsonian/Coastal-Wetland-NGGI-Sensitivity-Analysis/tree/master/scripts/0%20formatting/biomass) subfolder contains ordered scripts for ingesting biomass datasets as they were received and reformatted for machine readability, reformats them to a common structure, and compiles them into a single file.

The [ccap](https://github.com/Smithsonian/Coastal-Wetland-NGGI-Sensitivity-Analysis/tree/master/scripts/0%20formatting/ccap) folder contains a script for generating a table to join landcover change data to coastal change analysis program raster values, for various data management tasks.
